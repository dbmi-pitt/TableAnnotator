Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin.

It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).","Drugs that may decrease T                                       4                                        5' - deiodinase activity",SUBHEADER
