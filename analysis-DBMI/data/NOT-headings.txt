Ibuprofen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of ibuprofen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.

"Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of levothyroxine by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Calcium carbonate may form an insoluble chelate with levothyroxine, and ferrous sulfate likely forms a ferric-thyroxine complex. Administer levothyroxine at least 4 hours apart from these agents.

"Long-term lithium therapy can result in goiter in up to 50% of patients, and either subclinical or overt hypothyroidism, each in up to 20% of patients. The fetus, neonate, elderly and euthyroid patients with underlying thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis or with Grave's disease previously treated with radioiodine or surgery) are among those individuals who are particularly susceptible to iodine-induced hypothyroidism. Oral cholecystographic agents and amiodarone are slowly excreted, producing more prolonged hypothyroidism than parenterally administered iodinated contrast agents. Long-term amino-glu-tethimide therapy may minimally decrease T4 and T3 levels and increase TSH, although all values remain within normal limits in most patients."

Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse reactions and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co-administration with CIPRO XR are advised.
CIPRO XR inhibits the formation of paraxanthine after caffeine administration (or pentoxifylline containing products). Monitor for xanthine toxicity and adjust dose as necessary.
"Cipro XR may further prolong the QT interval in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the QT interval (for example, class IA or III antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, antipsychotics) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]."
CIPRO XR should be taken at least two hours before or six hours after Multivalent cation-containing products administration. [See Dosage and Administration (2).]
Concomitant administration of tizanidine and CIPRO XR is contraindicated due to the potentiation of hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine [see Contraindications (4.2)].
"Concurrent administration of CIPRO XR with theophylline may result in increased risk of a patient developing central nervous system (CNS) or other adverse reactions. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6).]"
"Decrease CIPRO XR absorption, resulting in lower serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired for concurrent administration of these agents with CIPRO XR"
DigoxinEnalaprilIronMetoprololWarfarin
Dosing Recommendations\Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamerTake at least 2 hours before sevelamer
"Hypoglycemia sometimes severe has been reported when CIPRO XR and oral antidiabetic agents, mainly sulfonylureas (for example, glyburide, glimepiride), were co-administered, presumably by intensifying the action of the oral antidiabetic agent. Fatalities have been reported. Monitor blood glucose when CIPRO XR is co-administered with oral antidiabetic drugs. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).]"
I.Due to the competition of salicylate with other drugs for binding to serum albumin the following drug interactions may occur:
"If unavoidable monitor, for duloxetine toxicity "
Monitor for sildenafil toxicity [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3\)].
Monitor renal function (in particular serum creatinine) when CIPRO XR is co-administered with cyclosporine.
Monitoring for ropinirole-related adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co-administration with CIPRO XR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (but not acetyl salicylic acid) in combination of very high doses of quinolones have been shown to provoke convulsions in pre-clinical studies and in postmarketing. 
"Potential increase in the risk of methotrexate associated toxic reactions. Therefore, carefully monitor patients under methotrexate therapy when concomitant CIPRO XR therapy is indicated."
Potentiation of CIPRO XR toxicity may occur.

"The concomitant use of CNS depressants can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death."
"The risk may vary with the underlying infection, age and general status of the patient so that the contribution of CIPRO XR to the increase in INR (international normalized ratio) is difficult to assess. Monitor prothrombin time and INR frequently during and shortly after co-administration of CIPRO XR with an oral anti-coagulant (for example, warfarin)."
"There have been a number of reports regarding coma and death associated with the misuse and abuse of the combination of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines. In many, but not all of these cases, buprenorphine was misused by self-injection of crushed buprenorphine tablets. Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of benzodiazepines and buprenorphine altered the usual ceiling effect on buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression, making the respiratory effects of buprenorphine appear similar to those of full opioid agonists."
"To avoid the loss of seizure control associated with decreased phenytoin levels and to prevent phenytoin overdose-related adverse reactions upon CIPRO XR discontinuation in patients receiving both agents, monitor phenytoin therapy, including phenytoin serum concentration during and shortly after co-administration of CIPRO XR with phenytoin."
Use with caution\(Increase in anticoagulant effect)
Use with caution\(interferes with renal tubular secretion of CIPRO XR and increases CIPRO XR serum levels)
Use with caution\(transient elevations in serum creatinine)
Use with caution\Altered serum levels of phenytoin (increased and decreased)
Use with caution\Glucose-lowering effect potentiated
Use with caution\Inhibition of methotrexate renal tubular transport potentially leading to increased methotrexate plasma levels

"Administration of these agents with levothyroxine results in an initial transient increase in FT4. Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T4 and normal FT4 and TSH concentrations and, therefore, patients are clinically euthyroid. Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4, is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total-T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%."

"Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decrease the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. In patients treated with large doses of propranolol ( > 160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change slightly, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above)."
